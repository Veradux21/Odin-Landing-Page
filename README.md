##Take Aways
1) viewbox based sizing is not always the best solution
2) I need to come back and figure out how to make the header and hero space the same. (Maybe review the ways I have constructed each box model)
3) Flex-grow only controls the main direction as defined by flex-direction. Resolve by adding: 
`align-self:center;` in addition to flex-grow
